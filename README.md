# Machine-Learning
Class submissions for the Machine Learning course (Data Science series at JHU)

The .html file is listed in the above directory with this label: Personality_Activity_Patterns_W_Figures.html

The .Rmd file is listed in the above directory with this label: Personality Activity Patterns W Figures.Rmd

Please note: There is a cache folder: Pattern_Activity_Patterns_cache/html - THIS IS THE WRONG FOLDER. I did not want to delete anything after I had subnmitted. So, I left it there. Please ignore it. 

I ran out of time to set up a gh-page to showcase the .html file. However, I used the Github automatic webpage generator to generate a webpage (which is also called a gh-pages branch). 

My partially useful gh-page is  located here: http://shankar4.github.io/Machine-Learning/ 

You will be able to download the zip directly from this repo page (note the 'Download ZIP' button on the right hand side, in line with the label 'READEME.md') or the web page (gh-page) listed above. Sorry, the gh-page does not showcase the .html file (ran out of time) 

Thanks!
