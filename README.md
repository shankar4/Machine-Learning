# Machine-Learning
Class submissions for the Machine Learning course (Data Science series at JHU)

The .html file is listed in the above directory with this label: Personality_Activity_Patterns_W_Figures.html

The .Rmd file is listed in the above directory with this label: Personality Activity Patterns W Figures.Rmd

Please note: There is a cache folder: Pattern_Activity_Patterns_cache/html - THIS IS THE WRONG FOLDER. I did not want to delete anything after I had subnmitted. So, I left it there. Please ignore it. 

I ran out of time to set up a gh-page to showcase the .html file. However, I used the Github automatic webpage generator to generate a webpage (which is also called a gh-pages branch). 

My partially useful gh-page is  located here: http://shankar4.github.io/Machine-Learning/ 

You will be able to download the zip directly from this page. Sorry, publishing the html page was not achieved. 

Thanks!
